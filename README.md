# CRM
Customer Project

Hello!

This is the step by step to Run the Application:

1) Download all files from the repository.
2) Unzip the following files in the project root:
- CRM.zip
- CRM.Business.zip
- CRM.Model.zip
- packages.zip
Note: All projects mentioned above must be at the same directory level because they communicate with each other.
3) After all the files are uncompressed, double-click the CRM.sln file and the project will run.
4) Run the project and it will run in the browser through IIS Express.

Any doubt I am available.
